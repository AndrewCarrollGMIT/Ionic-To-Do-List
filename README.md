# Ionic-To-Do-List

Ionic To - Do List App
=====================

My To-Do-List Application is based on three different categories for a user to choose from: "Work", "Home" or "Extra Tasks"

The user can simply Type what he/she wishes to add to the tasks tab and click on the 3 individual buttons on which ever category they wish to send it to.

The Categories are Colour Synced to allow for the user to distinguish simply between each task.

My To-Do-List is a simple Application used to just base your tasks around these 3 categories Which I felt were the most important for users.
